== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoBlocks free? =
Yes! CoBlock's core features are absolutely free.

= How do I start using Gutenberg? =
To get the full experience of the next-generation WordPress block editor, it helps to have a properly Gutenberg-optizied WordPress theme, like [this one](https://themebeans.com/themes/tabor?utm_medium=coblocks-lite&utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=tabor). Then install either WordPress 5.0+, or the offical Gutenberg [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/).

= How do I use my first CoBlocks Gutenberg blocks? =
CoBlocks adds its Gutenberg blocks to the new WordPress editor, so you can use them exactly how you would any other WordPress blocks. Once the plugin is installed, create or edit a WordPress page or post, add a new block using the plus icon, and you'll find all of CoBlocks' WordPress blocks available.

= What WordPress themes work with CoBlocks? =
Any properly developed WordPress theme will work with CoBlocks, though if you're looking for an exceptional theme, check out [Tabor](https://themebeans.com/themes/tabor?utm_medium=coblocks-lite&utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=tabor).

Developers can also apply minor style touch-ups to their themes if necessary. If you're a developer and you need help, don't hesitate to [reach out](https://coblocks.com).
